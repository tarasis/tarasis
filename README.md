## 🕰️ Short History 🕰️

Once upon a time I was an embedded systems engineer working in C, C++ & Java (with some Ruby on the side), and admin for the company's Linux network. During this time I was tech editor for the book **Eclipse in Action** (Manning Publishing), before also becoming a writer on the book.

After 5 years I left and became a stay at home parent. In 2007 I got my first Mac, and started to learn Objective-C and Mac programming to keep my hand in.

Then the iPhone came along, and I started to learn iPhone development. Along the way I worked as technical editor and reviewer on a number of Mac and iPhone books.

Throughout this time I self hosted my website & email server amongst other things. I've also provided Linux support for others.

## 📚 Currently working on ... 📚

In 2021/2022 I started to learn HTML, CSS and JavaScript programming. At the moment I am mostly focused on completing [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/profile/tarasis) challenges.

I have two iPhone/iPadOS apps in progress. One is a Kaomoji keyboard & sticker generator in SwiftUI. The other for managing Twitter Lists.

I've just started [SoundpoolBrowser](https://github.com/tarasis/SoundpoolBrowser), a Mac app for managing Soundpool sets from Magix & Producer Planet. Its not intended for sale, highly niche and intended for me to make it easier to pick samples for Garageband / Logic Pro.

I'm updating my old [Quiet Unrar](https://github.com/tarasis/QuietUnrar) Mac project. Well I'm supposed to be :)

I've also begun learning Unity & C#.

<p>

### Why **Tarasis**?

It was a D&D character name I made up for a bard thief back in 89/90 when I was 13 or 14. Years later I discovered that it was the original name of the Roman Emperor [Zeno](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeno_(emperor)), that it was the [name](http://www.tarasiselectric.com) of an electric company in the United States of America and the [surname](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konstantinos_Tarasis) of a Greek footballer & manager.

When I can't get `tarasis` as a username, then I use `duemoko`.

### Why a purple fedora?

I love the colour purple, and I often wear a black fedora.</p>
